# Computer Vision-fundamentals-with OpenCV
These practices contain image processing with the OpenCV library written in Python. The tutorials are partly from the Youtube Chanel ProgrammingKnowledge. Definitly check his videos for in depth explanations: <br />

# Overview
- Import Cameravideo
- Line Drawing in video
- Morphological Transformation
- MouseEvent Coordinate
- Movement Detection
- Reduce Resolution
- Split&Merge
- Text on Video
- Treshholding
- Trackbar & Switch
- Tracking based on Color
- Camera based Localization
- Advanced Object Tracking

# 1.) Import Cameravideo
This is the basic code importing video from an USB port and displaying it in an while loop. 



# 2.) Line Drawing in video
These Script shows how to draw lines in an video with the cv2.line function. The exact coordinates of the points has to be given into the function. The third parameter defines the color and the fourth one the thickness of the lines.<br /> Heres one example:<br />
```cv2.line(frame,points[-1], points[-2], (255,0,0), 5)``` <br />
Note that you have to click on 5 points before its starts to draw the lines.
